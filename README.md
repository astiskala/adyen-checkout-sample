### Setting up Webhooks

#### Option 1: Natively

If you have hosted this demo on a publicly accessible server, you can configure
your Adyen account to point to https://your-host/server/webhook/receive.php

#### Option 2: Using Webhook Relay

Webhook Relay will allow you to see the result of webhook notifications in
real time as payments are made.

1. Sign up for a free account at https://webhookrelay.com/
2. Create a new bucket
3. Edit the Endpoint Settings for the default public endpoint and set the
   "Static response body" to always return [accepted]
4. Create a new access token
5. Set the bucket name, access key and secret in your .env file
